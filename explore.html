    <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
    <p>
      Cyberyantra started with a simple aim: to create an
      <span class="highlight">internet-friendly awareness portal</span> that
      empowers people to recognize and defend against digital threats. We’ve
      worked to spread awareness about
      <span class="highlight"
        >phishing, fake SMS, fake websites, and social engineering</span
      >, helping individuals and organizations learn how to stay safe.
    </p>
    <h2>WHERE ARE WE HEADING</h2>
    <p>
      Our founding team is small and busy, but the demand for strong
      cybersecurity solutions is only growing. That’s why we are evolving from
      awareness into an <span class="highlight">“attack to secure” model</span>:
      a professional offensive security service dedicated to exposing
      vulnerabilities and securing systems before malicious actors can exploit
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until we fully assemble our team and structure, we’ll continue focusing on
      online awareness,
      <span class="highlight">surface-level cybercrime research</span>, and
      innovative methods to counter new attack strategies. Good news is coming
      our way, we’re closer than ever to making this a reality.
    </p>
    <h2>OUR AIM</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to secure every system possible, by
      <span class="highlight"
        >disclosing vulnerabilities, supporting companies, collaborating with
        recognized organizations</span
      >, and delivering professional services that meet the highest industry
      standards.
    </p>
    <h2>WILL CYBERYANTRA BE UNIQUE?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, Because we are not just reacting, we are building a
      <span class="highlight">community-driven defense force</span> shaped by
      offensive security expertise and public awareness. This dual focus makes
      us different, agile, and uniquely prepared for the challenges ahead.
